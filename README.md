# My Life Balances

During my Dimploma I had worked in a small team of three to develop an android mobile app that would meet client specifications
Features laid out by the client included:
..* User account and user authentication - to store user results from the quiz
..* SQL Database interface - this calls questions from the database, save responses and user preferences as objects that can be recalled at any time for further analysis.

Last time this app was compiled was from May of 2017 and may require recompilation to run on the latest versions of android.
